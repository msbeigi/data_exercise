# HealthExpenditure Prediction with Optuna and RandomForest

The code uses the `Optuna` library to optimize the hyperparameters of the model and compares the performance of the optimized model against a default configuration. The dataset used is the "healthexp" dataset, which contains information about health expenditures and life expectancy for various countries.
